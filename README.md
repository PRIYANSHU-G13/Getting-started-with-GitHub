# Getting-started-with-GitHub
This is the first repository for us to learn about how to use GitHub and how are we gonna implement our Python project here.
This is sample repo for our practise
Decide the project
As soon as we get any project, we will create a new repository.
It is just to learn and see how is it working.
try to create branches and see how to merge to using pull requests. learn about it and apply it here. Then we'll start with our project.
